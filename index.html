      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p>
        This is a simple static website designed to demonstrate how easy it is to host a web page using only HTML and CSS. Static websites are fast, secure, and easy to maintain. They're perfect for personal portfolios, documentation, blogs, and small business sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike dynamic websites, static websites don’t rely on databases or server-side scripting languages. All content is delivered exactly as written in the files. This means faster load times and fewer security vulnerabilities. Hosting static sites is also extremely cost-effective, especially with platforms like GitHub Pages that offer free hosting.
